## Now read some Hobbit propaganda!

In the middle of the earth in the land of the Shire,
lives a brave little hobbit whom we all admire.
With his long wooden pipe,
fuzzy, woolly toes,
he lives in a hobbit-hole and everybody knows him,
Bilbo! Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!
He's only three feet tall!
Bilbo! Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!
The bravest little hobbit of them all.
Now hobbits are a peace-lovin' folks you know,
they don't like to hurry and they take things slow,
they don't like to travel away from home,
they just want to eat and be left alone,
but one day Bilbo was asked to go,
on a big adventure to the caves below,
to help some dwarves get back their gold,
that was stolen by a dragon in the days of old.
Bilbo! Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!
He's only three feet tall!
Bilbo! Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!
The bravest little hobbit of them all.
Well he fought with the goblins!
He battled a troll!!
He riddled with Gollum!!!
A magic ring he stole!!!
He was chased by wolves!!
Lost in the forest!!!
Escaped in a barrel from the elf-king's halls!!!
Bilbo! Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!
The bravest little hobbit of them all.
Now he's back in his hole in the land of the Shire, 
that brave little hobbit whom we all admire,
just a-sittin' on a treasure of silver and gold,
a puffin' on his pipe in his hobbit-hole.
Bilbo! Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!
He's only three feet tall!
Bilbo! Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!
The bravest little hobbit of them all.
